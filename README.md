# Gas-Turbine-Blade-Cooling-CFD
CFD conjugate heat transfer analysis of a gas turbine blade with internal cooling channels using ANSYS Fluent.
## Gas Turbine Blade Cooling – Conjugate Heat Transfer CFD Analysis
This project investigates the temperature distribution and cooling effectiveness of a gas turbine blade operating under high-temperature conditions. Modern turbine inlet temperatures exceed material limits, therefore internal cooling is required to maintain blade integrity and performance.
## Objectives
- Model a turbine blade with internal cooling channels 
- Simulate heat transfer between hot gases, blade metal, and cooling air
- Evaluate temperature distribution and thermal loading regions
## Method
- Geometry created in ANSYS SpaceClaim
- Meshing performed in ANSYS Workbench
- Conjugate Heat Transfer simulation in ANSYS Fluent
- Air used as coolant inside internal passages
- High-temperature gas flow applied on external blade surface
## Key Findings
- Leading edge experiences highest heat flux
- Internal cooling significantly reduces metal temperature
- Cooling airflow rate strongly affects blade thermal safety
## Software & Tools Used
- ANSYS Fluent
- ANSYS Workbench
- ANSYS SpaceClaim
- CFD Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) Solver
## Boundary Conditions
- Hot gas applied on external blade surface
- Cooling air flowing inside internal channels
- Convection heat transfer between fluid and solid walls
- Steady state thermal simulation
## Results
The temperature contour showed maximum thermal loading at the leading edge region of the blade. Cooling air flowing through the internal channels reduced the metal temperature significantly and maintained safe operating limits. Heat flux distribution confirmed that the leading edge is the most critical region requiring cooling.
## Future Work
Future work will include investigation of different coolant flow rates, channel geometries and comparison of cooling effectiveness. The study can also be extended to film cooling and transient thermal analysis.
## Engineering Importance
Gas turbine efficiency increases with higher turbine inlet temperature, but component life depends on thermal management. This study demonstrates the importance of internal cooling in maintaining turbine blade reliability.
